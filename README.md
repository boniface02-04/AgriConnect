# AgriConnect
AI-Powered Farming Assistant for Beginners in India – Personalized Roadmaps, Weather Alerts, Crop Scanning &amp; More..“Connecting Farmers to a Better Tomorrow.”
AgriConnect is a beautiful, easy-to-use AI app that helps *new farmers* (ex-IT people & complete beginners) in Bengaluru/Karnataka start and grow sustainable farming. It includes onboarding survey, personalized roadmaps, crop image scanning, weather + pest alerts, marketplace, and govt schemes — with great UX and offline fallback.

## ✨ Why AgriConnect Stands Out
- 🌱 *Personalized onboarding* survey → custom roadmap for beginners/ex-IT farmers
- 📸 *Scan crop/leaf* for disease/nutrient issues (using Gemini vision)
- 🌤️ *Weather forecast* + crop-specific alerts & irrigation tips
- 🛡️ *Pest risk warnings* tied to weather/season
- 🏪 Marketplace cards (vehicles, seeds, best prices)
- 🏛️ Govt schemes quick access (PM-KISAN, Crop Insurance, KCC Loans)
- 🟢 Online/Offline status indicator in top bar
- Mobile-like green design with big buttons, sidebar menu & stats

Built for *best UX* — simple, friendly, and focused on Karnataka farmers.

## Features
- Survey → Personalized Farming Roadmap
- Ask AI any farming question
- Scan Crop Image for Analysis
- Weather Forecast + Crop/Pest Alerts
- Marketplace & Best Prices
- Government Schemes & Eligibility
- Multilingual (English, Kannada, Hindi, etc.)
- Offline mode fallback

## What Makes It Different?
Unlike basic query tools, AgriConnect focuses on *new farmers* with onboarding, climate-smart advice, weather/pest integration, and polished UX — perfect for Bengaluru's urban-to-rural shift.
